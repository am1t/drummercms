# drummerCms

A personalized fork of [official drummerCms](https://github.com/scripting/drummerCms) template files. drummerCms is shell for Old School to connect it with Drummer. Released so other outliners can hook up to Old School for blogging.

## Why the fork?

Because I wanted to put my Drummer blog on a custom domain, behind HTTPS. The only way is to serve the `styles.css` and `code.js` over secure HTTP too. Plus it gives me an opportunity to change the style to my liking. As of now, style wise, there haven't been any changes or deviation from the official templates.
